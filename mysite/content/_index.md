Welcome to my website! I'm a Software Engineer based in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. I love creating things and have immense passion for problem solving, I strive on being a developer who bridges the gap between engineering and design and not easily convinced the User Experience will hit the mark! My particular interests lie in Software Engineering, Cloud Computing and Client-facing Web Development.

I work @ Capital One where I spend most of my time building highly scalable in-house applications, APIs based on Microservices architecture and Data Pipelines leveraging the AWS Suite to it's fullest extent. All my work is geared towards enabling marketing campaigns for the company's [AutoNavigator](https://www.capitalone.com/cars) division. Yes, I am in the spamming customers business right now.

When I'm not working, I'm out running. I am a [3x Marathoner](https://marathonview.net/search?query=karteek%20gole) and an aspiring triathlete. I am not very good at cycling, which is the one RBS discipline I definitely need to get better at (sigh!).
