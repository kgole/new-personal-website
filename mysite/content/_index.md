Welcome to my website! My name is Karteek and I am a Software Engineer based in Nashua, New Hampshire. I love creating things and have immense passion for problem solving, I strive on being a developer who bridges the gap between engineering and design and not easily convinced the User Experience will hit the mark! My particular interests lie in Software Engineering, Cloud Computing and Client-facing Web Development.

I have recently joined [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) in the capacity of a Senior Software Engineer. I work with a central team named Common Platform Solutions (CPS) within the Asset Management division which builds highly scalable in-house applications, APIs based on Microservices architecture and Data Pipelines leveraging the AWS Suite that helps facilitate internal mobility. Check out my [resume](Resume.pdf)!

Before this, I worked @ Capital One from Oct 2019 to February 2026, where I spent most of my time building tech required to enable marketing campaigns for the company's [AutoNavigator](https://www.capitalone.com/cars) division. Yes, I was in the spamming customers business before! :P

When I'm not working, I'm out running. I am a [3x Marathoner](https://marathonview.net/search?query=karteek%20gole) and an aspiring triathlete. I am planning to race in the 2026 Ironman 70.3 in Wilmington but I am not very good at cycling. This is the one RBS discipline I definitely need to get better at (sigh!).
