My old personal website looked hella dated so I decided it was time for a revamp. Since most of the shit here is going to be static, I decided to use [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io/), the world's fastest Static Site Generator.

Here's the link to the [codebase](https://github.com/kgole/new-personal-website).

It's still under construction and more details will be added here and also in the ReadMe section as I progress. I will perhaps also add a walkthrough about how to set the Hugo environment up on your own device.

More to follow..
