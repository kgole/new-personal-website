I will be signing up for the Ironman 70.3 event in Wilmington, North Carolina to race in October 2026. I need to figure out a way to finalize my gear first. Find a bike that suits my fat ass and a breathable tri-suit that doesn't feel like a fucking straitjacket.

Will keep adding shit here as I finalize my regimen and plan. Stay tuned!
